<h3>Powerlifting</h3>

<p>Powerlifting has been the most amazing fitness I started and put focus on. Its been the most challenging, yet the most rewarding.
    I found my most strength out of powerlifting, not only physically but mentally and I'm still working on my growth.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Squat</li>
    <li>Bench</li>
    <li>Deadlift</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gym | Virgin Active</h3>

<p>
    I like to ensure I still get other forms of fitness into my day-to-day exercises so I ensure I use time at he gym otherwise on cardio and or stretching.
</p>

<h3>Hiking</h3>

<p>Hiking is not only good for your health but helps free your mind and spirit. I love the outdoors and seeing the end results of a good hike - the views are totally worth it.
